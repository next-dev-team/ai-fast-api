## OpenAI-Compatible Server with gpt4free

### Implementation Plan

1. Set up FastAPI server structure
2. Integrate g4f inference

### Tasks

- [] Create main.py with FastAPI setup
- [x] Ensure `install_dependencies.py` creates and uses a virtual environment.
- [x] Update `dev_start.py` to run `main.py` using the virtual environment's Python executable.
- [x] Refine `install_dependencies.py` to handle global `uv` installation and correct dependency installation within the virtual environment.
